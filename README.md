# FPGA-12Hour-Clock


This module executes the Verilog-designed 12-hour clock on Basys 3 board. In this, DISP1 part of the FPAG is used to display the hours and minutes of the clock. LEDs are used to indicate AM/PM timing and to indicate whether clock mode is on or off. In this module, board buttons are used to set the clock timing according to user requirements.
